# Archive - Planning Documents

**Status:** ⚠️ ARCHIVED - Historical reference only

This directory contains planning documents and drafts from earlier development phases.

## Important Notice

**These documents may contain outdated metrics and claims:**
- Early hash drift estimates (3-10 bits) have been superseded by empirical validation (4-14 bits mean, 8.7 bits on UCF-101)
- Test counts may be outdated (27/27 vs current 35/35)
- Feature claims may not reflect current implementation

**For current, accurate documentation, see:**
- [Main README](../../README.md)
- [VERIFICATION_PROOF.md](../../VERIFICATION_PROOF.md)
- [Perceptual Hash Whitepaper](../Perceptual_Hash_Whitepaper.md)

## Purpose of This Archive

These documents are preserved for:
- **Historical context** - Understanding project evolution
- **Planning reference** - Early design decisions and rationale
- **Academic honesty** - Transparent documentation of the development process

**Do not cite metrics from archived documents** - they represent planning estimates, not validated results.
